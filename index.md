Requires dependencies: The code requires three dependencies: Express.js, Body-Parser, and Mongoose. These dependencies help with creating a web server, parsing HTTP requests, and interacting with a MongoDB database.


Creates an Express app: The code creates an instance of the Express app, which is a web server.


Configures middleware: The code configures three middleware functions:
bodyParser.json(): parses JSON data sent in HTTP requests.


express.static('public'): serves static files from a directory named public.


bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }): parses URL-encoded data sent in HTTP requests.


Connects to MongoDB: The code connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. It specifies the database URL and sets up event listeners for errors and successful connections.


Defines routes: The code defines two routes:
POST /sign_up: Handles sign-up requests. It extracts data from the request body, creates a new user document, and inserts it into the users collection in the database. If successful, it redirects the user to a signup_success.html page.


GET /: Handles requests to the root URL (/). It sets an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to allow cross-origin requests and serves an index.html file from the public directory.
Starts the server: The code starts the Exp
ress app server, listening on port 3000.
In simple terms, this code sets up a web server that:


Listens for sign-up requests and stores user data in a MongoDB database.


Serves an index.html file when the root URL is accessed.


Allows cross-origin requests from other domains.


Note that this code has some security concerns, such as storing passwords in plain text. In a real-world application, you should use password hashing and salting to protect user passwords.


An error event listener that logs an error message to the console if there's a problem connecting to the database.
An open event listener that logs a success message to the console when the connection to the database is established.
By using db.on() and db.once(), we can react to different events in the connection lifecycle and handle errors or successes accordingly.


app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.set({
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
  });
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});


Allows access to the website from anywhere

Send the index.html file: The second line res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html') sends a file called index.html to the user's browser. The __dirname variable refers to the current directory of the Node.js script, so it's sending the index.html file from the same directory as the script.
